I am a PhD candidate in the department of Psychology working with Kalanit Grill-Spector. I am interested in the relationship between structure and function in human visual cortex, and in particular, the anatomical structures that scaffold development. Before coming to Stanford, I completed my BA in Cognitive Science at Pomona College and was the lab manager of the Brain Development & Education Lab at the University of Washington.
