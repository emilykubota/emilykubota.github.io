To test this question, we scanned children ages 7-12 using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 

 
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/kid1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/kid2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/mri.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
</div>

We examined the region of the brain involved in reading and found that it responded equally to works in skilled and struggling readers. However, it also responded to other categories in struggling readers.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/word_selectivity.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
</div>

These findings suggest that visual cortex does not become specialized for words in children with dyslexia compared to typical readers. For more information, check out our paper!
